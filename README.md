- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) at the University of Adelaide

Most of my time is spent working on closed-source projects which can't be seen here.

I love low-level system stuff.

Please don't ask me to make a front-end. I will do it in assembly and it won't be portable.
